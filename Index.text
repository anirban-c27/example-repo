This is a new text file that I'm creating during the 19-Dec githubify iitm session.
Example text.
Now commiting this file with a commit message. I can also add an image etc to the comment, can I?
I committed the Index.txt file and just added some more comments to it, but can't see it here in the Edit section. Where do I see it?
